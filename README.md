# CharGen is a "work-in-progress" pet project where I am creating a DnD 5e LV Character generator.

Not all classes are completely implimented, and the races only have the ability score adjustments implimented.
This also gives the generated character as a "Character".txt


As of my last push, I have Barbarian, Bard, and Cleric kinda completed.
I say Kinda because I am flipping from VSCode to digital copy of the Players' Handbook.
Which means that I could very well have missed something.

Below is a sample of the current output:
